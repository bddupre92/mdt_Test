# MoE Visualization Examples

This document provides sample images and outputs for the visualization capabilities implemented in the MoE framework. Each example is accompanied by a brief description and interpretation guide.

## Expert Contribution Visualizations

### Expert Usage Pie Chart

![Expert Usage Pie Chart](example_images/expert_usage_pie_chart.png)

**Description**: This visualization shows the proportion of samples where each expert is the dominant contributor. In this example, you can see that Expert 2 is selected most frequently (45%), followed by Expert 1 (30%) and Expert 3 (25%).

**Interpretation**: A well-balanced MoE should show meaningful contributions from multiple experts, though some dominance is expected based on the problem domain. If a single expert dominates completely (e.g., >90%), it may indicate that the other experts are not adding value or that the gating network is not effectively routing inputs.

### Expert Contribution Heatmap

**Description**: This heatmap visualizes how much each expert contributes to predictions across different input regions or samples. Darker colors represent stronger contributions.

**Interpretation**: Look for clear patterns of specialization, where different experts focus on different regions. This indicates the MoE is effectively distributing work based on expert strengths.

## Confidence Visualizations

### Confidence Histogram

![Confidence Histogram](example_images/confidence_histogram.png)

**Description**: This histogram shows the distribution of confidence scores across all predictions. The x-axis represents confidence values (0-1), and the y-axis shows the frequency of predictions at each confidence level.

**Interpretation**: A well-calibrated model should show a meaningful distribution of confidence values. Beware of models that are overconfident (all values near 1.0) or underconfident (values clustered at lower ranges).

### Confidence Calibration Plot

![Confidence Calibration Plot](example_images/confidence_calibration.png)

**Description**: This plot compares the expected accuracy (based on confidence scores) to the actual accuracy. The diagonal line represents perfect calibration.

**Interpretation**: Points close to the diagonal indicate good calibration. Points below the line suggest overconfidence (the model is less accurate than it believes), while points above the line suggest underconfidence.

## Comparison Visualizations

### Performance Comparison Bar Chart

![Performance Comparison](example_images/performance_comparison.png)

**Description**: This bar chart directly compares key metrics (RMSE and MAE) between the MoE approach and baseline methods. Lower values indicate better performance.

**Interpretation**: The MoE approach should show improved (lower) error metrics compared to baseline approaches. Look for substantial improvements in multiple metrics to confirm MoE's effectiveness.

### Radar Chart

![Radar Chart](example_images/radar_chart.png)

**Description**: This radar chart visualizes multiple performance metrics simultaneously, with each axis representing a different metric. The chart has been normalized so that higher values (further from center) represent better performance.

**Interpretation**: The MoE should ideally form a larger polygon than baseline approaches, indicating superior performance across multiple dimensions. Pay attention to any axes where MoE shows particular strengths or weaknesses.

### Convergence Curve

![Convergence Curve](example_images/convergence_curve.png)

**Description**: This line chart shows how error metrics evolve over training iterations or epochs for different approaches.

**Interpretation**: The MoE approach should ideally show faster convergence (steeper initial decline) and/or better final performance (lower final value) compared to baselines.

## MoE-Specific Advanced Visualizations

### Expected Calibration Error (ECE)

![Expected Calibration Error](example_images/ece_visualization.png)

**Description**: This bar chart shows the calibration error across different confidence bins. The height of each bar represents the absolute difference between confidence and accuracy within that bin, weighted by the number of samples.

**Interpretation**: Lower bars indicate better calibration. Look for patterns where certain confidence ranges show particularly poor calibration, as these may require focused improvements.

### Expert Selection Frequency Over Time

![Expert Selection Over Time](example_images/expert_selection_time.png)

**Description**: This line chart shows how the frequency of expert selection evolves over time or across different data batches.

**Interpretation**: Stable lines suggest consistent expert specialization, while fluctuating lines may indicate either adaptability to changing data or instability in the gating network.

## Creating Your Own Visualizations

All visualizations are generated using the standard Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. You can customize these visualizations or create your own by accessing the raw metrics data:

```python
# Get raw metrics data
moe_metrics = moe_adapter.get_metrics()

# Access specific metrics
expert_contributions = moe_metrics["expert_contribution"]
confidence_metrics = moe_metrics["confidence"]

# Create custom visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# Your custom visualization code here
plt.savefig("my_custom_visualization.png")
```

> **Note**: The example images in this document are placeholders. When you run the visualization methods with your own MoE models, they will be replaced with actual visualizations based on your specific data and model performance.
