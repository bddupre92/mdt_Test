# Extended Comparison Analysis: Key Findings

## Overview

This document summarizes the key findings from the extended comparison between the Meta Optimizer and the SATzilla-inspired baseline selector.

## Performance Improvements

- The analysis examined benchmark performance across different problem types, dimensions, and drift characteristics
- Statistical significance was tested using both parametric (t-tests) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon) methods

## Problem Type Analysis

The Meta Optimizer showed different levels of improvement depending on problem type:

- For unimodal functions (e.g., sphere, rosenbrock), improvements were generally _modest but consistent_
- For multimodal functions (e.g., ackley, rastrigin), improvements were typically _larger_, showing Meta Optimizer's ability to handle complex search spaces
- For dynamic problems with drift, improvements were _most significant_, particularly with oscillatory and random drift types

## Algorithm Selection Patterns

The analysis revealed interesting patterns in algorithm selection:

- The SATzilla baseline tended to favor specific algorithms regardless of problem characteristics
- The Meta Optimizer demonstrated more context-sensitive selection, matching algorithms to problem features
- The most significant difference in selection patterns occurred in dynamic optimization problems

## Statistical Significance

Statistical tests were performed across various groupings:

- By problem type
- By dimension
- By drift type

For full details, see the [Statistical Analysis](statistical_tests/statistical_analysis.md) report.

## Conclusion

The extended comparison analysis provides strong evidence that the Meta Optimizer framework delivers significant performance improvements over the SATzilla-inspired baseline, particularly for complex and dynamic optimization problems.

This analysis completes the comparative baseline implementation phase of the project and confirms the theoretical advantage of the Meta Optimizer's approach.
