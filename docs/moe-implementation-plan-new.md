# Evolutionary Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for integrating an Evolutionary Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system into the existing meta_optimizer framework. The MoE architecture features domain-specialized expert models optimized through evolutionary algorithms (DE, ES, ACO, GWO, ABC), a dynamic gating network tuned via swarm intelligence, and integration with our existing explainability framework. The goal is to build a system capable of robust, interpretable migraine prediction across heterogeneous patient profiles.

### Vision

The Evolutionary Mixture-of-Experts framework represents a significant advancement in our migraine prediction capabilities by:

1. **Domain-Specific Expertise**: Rather than using a one-size-fits-all model, the MoE approach leverages specialized models for different data domains (physiological, environmental, behavioral, medication history).

2. **Adaptive Weighting**: The dynamic gating network intelligently determines which experts to trust more for each patient based on their specific data characteristics.

3. **Evolutionary Optimization**: By applying different evolutionary algorithms optimally matched to each domain's unique characteristics, we achieve better performance than any single optimization approach.

4. **Personalization**: The system adapts to individual patient characteristics through both the gating network and quality-aware weighting mechanisms.

5. **Interpretability**: The modular nature of the MoE system provides inherent explainability - stakeholders can see which factors (experts) contribute most to predictions for different patients.

This vision bridges our existing meta_optimizer framework with cutting-edge ensemble techniques and evolutionary computation to create a powerful, personalized migraine prediction system.

### 3.2 Current Implementation Status

The current implementation differs from the proposed directory structure. Instead of a unified `meta_optimizer/moe` directory, the MoE functionality is distributed across several components:

- **Core Meta-Optimizer Framework** (`/meta_optimizer/meta/meta_optimizer.py`)
  - Provides the foundation for algorithm selection and execution
  - Implements the SATzilla-inspired algorithm selector
  - Manages optimization history and performance tracking

- **Evolutionary Computation Algorithms** (`/meta_optimizer/optimizers/`)
  - Individual implementations of DE, ES, ACO, and GWO algorithms
  - Base optimizer interface that all algorithms implement
  - Factory pattern for algorithm instantiation and configuration

- **MoE Framework** (`/moe_framework/`)
  - Separate from meta_optimizer, focusing on data handling and execution
  - Data connectors for various data sources
  - Execution management for MoE components

- **MoE Tests** (`/moe_tests/`)
  - Testing framework for MoE components
  - Integration tests for preprocessing and gating mechanisms

### 3.3 Integration with Legacy Components

1. **Meta-Optimizer Integration**
   - The MoE framework leverages the existing Meta-Optimizer for algorithm selection
   - Expert models use the optimizer implementations from `/meta_optimizer/optimizers/`
   - Problem characterization from `/meta_optimizer/meta/problem_analysis.py` informs algorithm selection

2. **Evolutionary Algorithm Integration**
   - Expert models are trained using specific EC algorithms:
     - Physiological Expert: Differential Evolution (DE) from `/meta_optimizer/optimizers/de.py`
     - Environmental Expert: Evolution Strategy (ES) from `/meta_optimizer/optimizers/es.py`
     - Behavioral Expert: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) from `/meta_optimizer/optimizers/aco.py`
     - Gating Network: Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) from `/meta_optimizer/optimizers/gwo.py`
   - All algorithms implement the common interface defined in `/meta_optimizer/optimizers/base_optimizer.py`

3. **Theoretical Foundations**
   - The SATzilla-inspired algorithm selection approach from the Meta-Optimizer provides the theoretical basis for expert algorithm selection
   - The problem characterization techniques in `/meta_optimizer/meta/problem_analysis.py` inform the gating network's decision-making
   - Drift detection mechanisms from `/meta_optimizer/drift_detection/` support adaptive expert weighting
