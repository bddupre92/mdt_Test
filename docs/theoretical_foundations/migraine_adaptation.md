## Physiological Signal Processing

### Theory

The physiological signal processing is based on signal-specific theoretical frameworks:

1. **ECG/HRV Analysis**
   - Pan-Tompkins algorithm for QRS detection
   - Time-domain HRV features:
     \[
     SDNN = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N (RR_i - \overline{RR})^2}
     \]
     \[
     RMSSD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N (RR_{i+1} - RR_i)^2}
     \]

2. **EEG Processing**
   - Frequency band decomposition:
     - Delta (0.5-4 Hz)
     - Theta (4-8 Hz)
     - Alpha (8-13 Hz)
     - Beta (13-30 Hz)
     - Gamma (30-45 Hz)
   - Power spectral density estimation:
     \[
     P_{xx}(f) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} |X(f)|^2
     \]

3. **Skin Conductance**
   - Tonic and phasic component separation
   - SCR detection and quantification
   - Artifact removal techniques

4. **Respiratory Analysis**
   - Breathing rate estimation
   - Variability assessment
   - Depth analysis

### Implementation

Each physiological signal has a dedicated adapter class implementing:
- Signal-specific preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Quality assessment

Example usage:
```python
# Initialize adapters
ecg_adapter = ECGAdapter()
eeg_adapter = EEGAdapter()

# Process ECG signal
processed_ecg = ecg_adapter.preprocess(ecg_data, sampling_rate=250)
ecg_features = ecg_adapter.extract_features(processed_ecg, sampling_rate=250)

# Process EEG signal
processed_eeg = eeg_adapter.preprocess(eeg_data, sampling_rate=250)
eeg_features = eeg_adapter.extract_features(processed_eeg, sampling_rate=250)
```

### Quality Assessment

Each adapter implements signal-specific quality metrics:

1. **ECG Quality**
   - Signal-to-noise ratio
   - R-peak detectability
   - Baseline stability

2. **EEG Quality**
   - Artifact presence
   - Line noise levels
   - Signal stability

3. **Skin Conductance Quality**
   - Range validation
   - Motion artifact detection
   - Response identification

4. **Respiratory Quality**

- Implement fallback strategies for low-quality data
- Track reliability metrics across time
- Document quality assessment decisions

### Integration

- Maintain temporal alignment across signals
- Consider physiological relationships between signals
- Handle different sampling rates and latencies
- Implement robust error handling

## Mathematical Foundations

### Signal Processing

1. **Bandpass Filtering**
   \[
   H(s) = \frac{s/\omega_1}{(s/\omega_1 + 1)(s/\omega_2 + 1)}
   \]

2. **Power Spectral Density**
   \[
   S_{xx}(f) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \mathbb{E}[|X_T(f)|^2]
   \]

### Feature Extraction

1. **HRV Time Domain**
   \[
   pNN50 = \frac{NN50}{n-1} \times 100\%
   \]
   where NN50 is the number of successive differences exceeding 50ms

2. **EEG Band Power**
   \[
   P_{\text{band}} = \int_{f_1}^{f_2} S_{xx}(f) df
   \]

### Quality Assessment

1. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**
   \[
   SNR = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{signal}}}{P_{\text{noise}}}\right)
   \]

2. **Quality Score Normalization**
   \[
   Q = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(x - \beta)}}
   \]
   where α and β are signal-specific parameters
