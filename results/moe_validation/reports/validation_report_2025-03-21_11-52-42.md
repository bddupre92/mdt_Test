## Explainability Results

The validation framework tested the explainability components with the following focus areas:

1. Feature importance generation and visualization
2. Individual prediction explanations
3. Optimizer behavior explainability

For detailed explainability visualizations, refer to the generated plots in the results directory.

## Drift Detection and Adaptation Results

The validation framework tested the drift detection and adaptation mechanisms with these key metrics:

1. Drift detection accuracy on synthetic drift scenarios
2. Adaptation response to detected drift
3. Performance impact analysis before and after adaptation

For detailed drift detection results, refer to the CSV reports in the results directory.

## Explainable Drift Results

The validation framework integrates explainability with drift detection to provide the following insights:

1. Feature-level drift analysis - identifying which features contribute most to drift
2. Human-readable drift explanations for clinicians and stakeholders
3. Visual representation of pre-drift and post-drift feature importance

**Key Insight**: Drift detected: True, Magnitude: 109778.5943, Top drift features: feature_3, feature_0, feature_1

### Drift Detection Visualizations

#### Feature Importance Changes Before vs After Drift

This visualization shows how feature importance metrics shift when concept drift occurs, helping identify which features are most affected by the drift.

![Feature Importance Changes](../drift_feature_importance_comparison.png)

The left chart compares feature importance values before and after drift, while the right chart shows the absolute magnitude of importance shift for each feature. Features with larger shifts are most affected by the drift and may require special attention during model updates.

#### Feature Distribution Changes Due to Drift

This visualization shows how the statistical distributions of key features change when concept drift occurs.

![Feature Distribution Changes](../feature_distribution_changes.png)

For each feature, the visualization shows:
- Histogram comparison before and after drift (left)
- Density plot comparison (right)
- Statistical summary of changes in mean and standard deviation

This analysis helps clinicians understand not just *that* drift occurred, but *how* the underlying data distributions have changed.

#### Temporal Evolution of Feature Importance

This visualization tracks how feature importance evolves over time as drift occurs, providing insight into the gradual shift in feature relevance.

![Temporal Feature Importance](../temporal_feature_importance.png)

The visualization presents two complementary views:
- Heatmap showing importance values for each feature across time windows (top)
- Line chart tracking importance trends with the drift point highlighted (bottom)

**Top Feature Evolution:**

| Time Window | Top Feature | Importance Value |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Pre-Drift 1 | feature_0 | 0.8007 |
| Pre-Drift 2 | feature_0 | 0.8110 |
| Transition | feature_3 | 0.5666 |
| Post-Drift 1 | feature_3 | 0.9096 |
| Post-Drift 2 | feature_3 | 0.8985 |

This temporal analysis reveals how the relative importance of features changes during the drift transition period, providing deeper insights into the drift mechanics.

#### Human-Readable Drift Explanation

The system generates a natural language explanation of detected drift:

```
Drift detected with magnitude 109778.5943. The most significant changes were:
- feature_0: Changed from -0.0024 to 0.0161 (764.45% change)
- feature_1: Changed from -0.0673 to 0.1310 (294.53% change)
- feature_4: Changed from -0.0430 to 0.0200 (146.46% change)

```

These insights enable more targeted model updates and provide stakeholders with understandable explanations of why model behavior has changed.

## Integrated System Workflow

The end-to-end system tests validated the complete MoE workflow including:

1. Expert training and registration
2. Gating network training and weight prediction
3. Ensemble prediction generation
4. Drift detection and adaptive response
5. Explainability generation for system decisions

## Recommendations

Based on the validation results, we recommend the following next steps:

1. ✅ The MoE system is performing well and ready for further development
2. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for:
   - Real-world clinical data scenarios
   - Performance under resource constraints
   - Integration with the broader migraine prediction system
