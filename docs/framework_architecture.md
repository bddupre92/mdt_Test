## Core Framework Components

### Optimizers

The optimizers component provides implementations of various optimization algorithms:

- BaseOptimizer: Abstract base class for all optimizers
- OptimizerFactory: Factory for creating optimizer instances
- Concrete optimizers:
  - DifferentialEvolutionOptimizer (DE): Population-based evolutionary algorithm
  - EvolutionStrategyOptimizer (ES): Self-adaptive evolutionary algorithm
  - AntColonyOptimizer (ACO): Swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by ant behavior
  - GreyWolfOptimizer (GWO): Nature-inspired algorithm based on grey wolf hunting patterns
  - MetaOptimizer: Algorithm that selects and configures the best optimization approach

All concrete optimizer implementations have been completed and integrated into the benchmarking system. **Note: While core implementations are complete, frontend integration and visualization require enhancements.**

### Meta-Learner

The meta-learner selects the best optimizer for a given problem:

- MetaOptimizer: Main class for meta-optimization
- ProblemAnalyzer: Extracts problem characteristics
- MLAlgorithmSelector: Uses ML for algorithm selection

**Note: Implementation may need validation with a wider range of problem types.**

### Explainability

The explainability component explains optimizer behavior and model predictions:

- BaseExplainer: Abstract base class for all explainers
- ExplainerFactory: Factory for creating explainer instances
- Concrete explainers: ShapExplainer, LimeExplainer, OptimizerExplainer

**Note: Visualization of explanation outputs needs enhancement for better user comprehension.**

### Drift Detection

The drift detection component detects and adapts to concept drift:

- DriftDetector: Main class for drift detection
- Handles different types of drift: sudden, gradual, incremental, etc.

**Note: Testing with real-world evolving datasets needed to validate effectiveness.**

## Integration Points

### API Layer

The API layer provides a RESTful interface for the frontend:

- `/api/benchmarks/*`: Endpoints for running and retrieving benchmark results
- `/api/optimization/*`: Endpoints for running optimization processes
- `/api/visualization/*`: Endpoints for generating visualizations
- `/api/prediction/*`: Endpoints for making predictions

Current status:
- 🚧 API endpoints defined but not fully implemented - **Documentation and validation needed**
- 🚧 Connection between frontend and API in progress - **Error handling needs improvement**

### Frontend Integration

The frontend integrates with the backend via API clients:

- `lib/api/*.ts`: TypeScript API clients for different endpoints
- Components use React hooks for data fetching and state management

**Note: Error handling and loading states need enhancement for better user experience.**

## Data Flow Architecture

### Optimization Flow

1. User selects dataset and configures algorithm in the workflow interface
2. User starts execution through the Execution Control Panel
3. Execution API client creates a job and starts polling/WebSocket connection
4. Execution progress is monitored in real-time with resource utilization
5. Logs are displayed with filtering options for debugging
6. Results are stored and accessible in the results view
7. Visualizations show performance metrics and algorithm behavior

**Note: WebSocket connection is simulated for development but needs to be implemented for production with a real backend.**

### Execution Control Flow

1. User configures stopping criteria (iterations, target metrics, max time)
2. User sets resource allocation (parallelization, GPU usage, memory limits)
3. User starts execution with configured parameters
4. Real-time updates show progress, ETA, and resource utilization
5. Logs are filtered and displayed for monitoring
6. User can cancel execution if needed
7. Results are presented when execution completes

**Note: Current implementation uses mock data and simulated progress. Backend API implementation needed.**
