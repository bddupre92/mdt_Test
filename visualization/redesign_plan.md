# MoE Visualizer Redesign Plan

## 1. Architecture-Aligned Visualizations

The redesigned visualizer will directly reflect the MoE architecture:

### Component 1: Expert Models Visualization
- Expert performance radar charts (comparing all metrics)
- Domain-specific visualizations for each expert type:
  - Physiological expert: Signal analysis, feature importance
  - Environmental expert: Geographic/temporal patterns
  - Behavioral expert: Activity patterns, correlations
  - Medication expert: Medication effectiveness/timing

### Component 2: Gating Network Visualization
- Expert selection heatmap (which expert was chosen when)
- Expert weight distribution flow (Sankey diagram)
- Decision boundary visualization
- Expert selection error analysis

### Component 3: Integration Flow Visualization
- End-to-end pipeline diagram
- Data flow visualization
- Component interaction diagram
- Event flow visualization

### Component 4: Performance Analysis
- Overall metrics with statistical significance
- Component contribution analysis
- Comparative performance (MoE vs individual experts)
- Error analysis and outlier detection

## 2. Implementation Strategy

1. Create modular visualization functions for each architecture component
2. Add interactive elements where relevant
3. Generate comprehensive HTML report linking all visualizations
4. Include downloadable data/chart options

## 3. Technical Improvements

1. Use consistent styling and color schemes
2. Add proper error handling for missing data
3. Make all charts responsive and properly labeled
4. Ensure visualizations load correctly in all environments
