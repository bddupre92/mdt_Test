# Interactive Data Configuration Dashboard

## Overview

The Interactive Data Configuration Dashboard is a key component of the MoE Framework Phase 2 implementation. It provides a comprehensive interface for data preprocessing, quality assessment, and pipeline management.

## Components

### 1. Visual Pipeline Builder

The Visual Pipeline Builder allows users to create and configure preprocessing pipelines through an intuitive interface:

- **Standard Builder**: The default pipeline builder with a form-based interface
- **Visual Drag-and-Drop Builder**: An enhanced builder with visual components that can be arranged on a canvas
- **Features**:
  - Upload and preview data files (CSV, Excel)
  - Add, configure, and reorder preprocessing operations
  - Execute pipelines and view results
  - Save configurations for later use

#### Available Operations

| Operation | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Missing Value Handler | Handle missing values in the dataset | Method (mean, median, mode, constant), Fill value |
| Outlier Handler | Detect and handle outliers | Method (IQR, Z-score, isolation forest), Threshold |
| Feature Scaler | Scale features to a standard range | Method (standard, minmax, robust), Parameters |
| Category Encoder | Encode categorical variables | Method (one-hot, label, target) |
| Feature Selector | Select important features | Method (variance, correlation, importance) |
| Time Series Processor | Process time series data | Resampling, Lag features, Rolling statistics |

### 2. Advanced Data Quality Visualization

The Advanced Data Quality component provides comprehensive insights into data quality and characteristics:

- **Data Profile**: Overview of dataset structure, types, and basic statistics
- **Quality Scoring**: Quantitative assessment of data quality with metrics and recommendations
- **Distribution Analysis**: Statistical analysis of feature distributions with normality testing
- **Correlation Analysis**: Visualization of relationships between features
- **Time Series Analysis**: Temporal pattern analysis for time series data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of outliers and anomalies in the dataset

### 3. Template Management System

The Template Management System allows users to save, load, and share preprocessing configurations:

- **Browse Templates**: View available templates with filtering by category or tags
- **Save Templates**: Save current pipeline configuration with metadata
- **Share Templates**: Export templates for sharing with other users
- **Import Templates**: Import templates from external sources

## Integration with MoE Framework

The Interactive Data Configuration Dashboard integrates with other components of the MoE Framework:

- **Results Management**: Pipeline configurations can be linked to experiment results
- **Benchmark Dashboard**: Access through the main navigation interface
- **Framework Runner**: Configure data preprocessing for model training

## Usage

1. Navigate to the Data Configuration page from the main dashboard
2. Upload your dataset using the file uploader
3. Build your preprocessing pipeline by adding operations
4. Use the Advanced Data Quality tools to assess your data
5. Execute the pipeline to apply preprocessing
6. Save your configuration as a template for future use

## Technical Details

- Built with Streamlit for interactive web interface
- Uses pandas, scikit-learn, and other data science libraries for processing
- Modular design for easy extension with new operations
- Session state management for persistent configurations during user sessions
