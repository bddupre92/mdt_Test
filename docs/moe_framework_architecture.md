# MoE Framework Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the MoE (Mixture of Experts) framework architecture, detailing each component, its purpose, and connections to other components. This documentation serves as a living reference that will be updated as new components are added or existing ones are modified.

> **Update (2025-03-25)**: Added MoE Framework Interfaces section to document the unified interfaces created as part of Critical Path 3, Step 1. Updated to reflect completion of MoE metrics implementation, baseline framework integration, and validation framework.

## Overview

The MoE framework is designed with evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms as its core differentiator. The architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Extend existing components** rather than creating parallel implementations
2. **Use inheritance and composition** to add new functionality
3. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing interfaces
4. **Reuse existing configuration systems** and parameter structures

## MoE Framework Interfaces

### Using MoE Visualizations

#### Basic Usage

```python
# Using MoEBaselineComparison
comparison = MoEBaselineComparison(
    simple_baseline=simple_selector,
    meta_learner=meta_selector,
    enhanced_meta=enhanced_selector,
    satzilla_selector=satzilla_selector,
    moe_adapter=moe_adapter,
    output_dir="results/my_comparison"
)

# Run comparison
results = comparison.run_supervised_comparison(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

# Generate all visualizations
visualization_paths = comparison.visualize_results()

# For supervised comparison visualizations only
metrics_df = comparison.visualize_supervised_comparison(results)
```

#### Standalone Visualization

```python
# Using standalone visualization utility
from baseline_comparison.moe_comparison import visualize_moe_with_baselines

# Get MoE metrics
moe_metrics = moe_adapter.get_metrics()

# Define baseline metrics for comparison
baseline_metrics = {
    "meta": {"rmse": 0.45, "mae": 0.32},
    "satzilla": {"rmse": 0.42, "mae": 0.30}
}

# Generate comparison visualizations
paths = visualize_moe_with_baselines(
    moe_metrics=moe_metrics,
    baseline_metrics=baseline_metrics,
    output_dir="results/visualizations"
)
```

#### Customizing Visualizations

All visualization methods accept parameters to customize the output:

- **output_dir**: Directory where visualization files will be saved
- **prefix**: String prefix added to output filenames
- **save**: Boolean flag to control whether visualizations are saved to disk
- **name**: Base name for the visualization files

For example:

```python
# Customizing visualization output
comparison.visualize_supervised_comparison(
    results,
    output_dir="custom/path/to/visualizations",
    prefix="patient_123_analysis"
)
```

Specific visualization types can be customized through the metrics calculator:

```python
# Creating a metrics calculator with custom settings
from baseline_comparison.moe_metrics import MoEMetricsCalculator

metrics_calculator = MoEMetricsCalculator(
    output_dir="results/custom_visualizations",
    confidence_bins=20,  # Increase granularity of confidence visualizations
    figsize=(12, 8)      # Larger figure size for all plots
)

# Generate customized visualizations
paths = metrics_calculator.visualize_metrics(moe_metrics, name="custom_moe_analysis")
```
